<h2>Project Purpose and Goal</h2>
The goal of this project was to create a tool for Japanese language learners to assist them in learning the most common 2000 Kanji characters. Users are able to create kanji flashcards, with AI assisted prompt, image, and audio generation. Users are also able to browse other users kanji flashcards, add them to their own collection, and rate each flashcard. Users may then revise their created card, using the websites built in spaced-repition-system.

<h2>Webstack and Explanation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>NextJS</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>OpenAI API</li>
  <li>TailwindCSS</li>
  <li>Next Auth</li>
</ul>

This project was coded using NextJS, with the OpenAI API for the generation of card prompts, card audio (Text-to-speech), and image generation. Some challenging aspects of creating this website included: implementing the OpenAI API for multiple functions, the implementation of a spaced-repition-system (SRS) for the revision of kanji flashcards, the implementation of Kanji data for card collections, the implementation of a flashcard rating system and filtering of public flashcards based on rating and popularity.
